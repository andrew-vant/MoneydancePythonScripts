NOTE: I AM JUST A USER - I HAVE NO AFFILIATION WITH MONEYDANCE!

Minimum Moneydance version for use as an Extension: 2021 (build: 2012) - (Minimum version 2020 if run as a script)

This is a Python(Jython 2.7) script that runs inside of Moneydance via the Moneybox Python Interpreter
As such it has full access to Moneydance's internals.
However, where possible this script uses the published APIs. In certain circumstances, it calls internal functions.
The script will never change anything without your permission - and it will always ask you for such (several times).

DISCLAIMER: YOU USE THIS SCRIPT AT YOUR OWN RISK AND YOU ACCEPT ANY CONSEQUENCES OF CHANGING YOUR DATA!

PLEASE ALWAYS BACKUP YOUR DATA FIRST! You  can use the Export Backup (green) button top-left in Toolbox to do this.

PURPOSE

To enable the User to self-diagnose problems, or access key diagnostics to enable support to help
- Basic (default) mode is very safe - it contains view options only
- Advanced Mode - Allows user to run fixes - THIS CHANGES DATA
- Geek Mode - Allows user to view technical information/settings in various places (this is readonly)
- Hacker Mode - Allows the user to manually add/change/delete config.dict and LocalStorage() keys/values - ONLY USE IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING
                Also allows you to toggle Moneydance internal settings like DEBUG

- The Toolbox offers the option to Backup first  - ALWAYS BACKUP (But this is your choice!)
- The Toolbox will *ALWAYS* make a copy of config.dict, custom theme file, LocalStorage() ./safe/settings before any changes
>> These backup files will have a unique (timestamp-like) number and _$SAVED$ appended to the end of the filename

>> Your dataset backups will be located wherever you choose to save them (USE THE 'EXPORT BACKUP' button (top left in green)
>> Note the normal Moneydance Backup is a complete dataset, but does not include config.dict, custom theme file, extensions etc

- All updates (and other key messages) get written to the Moneydance console error log
