Extension format only >> Minimum Moneydance version 2021.1 (build: 3056, ideally 3069 onwards)
(If you have installed the extension, but nothing happens, then check your Moneydance version)

This is a Python(Jython 2.7) Extension that runs inside of Moneydance via the Moneybot Python Interpreter
It's a prototype to demonstrate the capabilities of Python. Yes - if you can do it in Java, you can do it in Python too!

DISCLAIMER: THIS EXTENSION IS READONLY - BUT YOU USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

PURPOSE

This extension creates a Moneydance Home Page View >> a little widget on the Home / Summary Screen dashboard

- Drag and drop the .mxt file onto the left side bar to install (or use Extensions, Manage Extensions, add from file)
- Once installed, visit Preferences > Summary Page, and then move the new widget to the desired Home screen location

- This widget allows you to select multiple accounts / categories - OR - Multiple Securities (by Investment Account)
- The balances are totalled and displayed on the Home screen widget, converted to the Currency you select to display

- My original concept was to add balances to target zero. Thus a positive number is 'good', a negative is 'bad'
- The idea is that you net cash and debt to get back to zero every month

- However, you could create a Net Worth Balance for example; you can use it for anything really

- To configure the widget, select an existing row on the Home Screen, or use the Extensions Menu

- You can add/delete/move as many rows as you require, and then configure the accounts for each row
- You can select to show.list Accounts & Categories - OR Securities....

- You can change the widget name, the balance type and the currency to display

- NOTE: This does not use recursive balance totalling, it simply uses the selected accounts' balance...
