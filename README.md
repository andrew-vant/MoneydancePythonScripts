# Moneydance Python Scripts

Visit: https://yogi1967.github.io/MoneydancePythonScripts/ for downloads...

My collection of Python(Jython 2.7) scripts and extensions for Moneydance (MoneyBot console)

NOTE: My script (*.py) and extension (*.mxt) programs are exactly the same. Just the method to run changes.....
If you downloaded a zip file (extension *.zip) then unzip first in a directory of your choice to get at the file(s)

Extensions will only run on Moneydance version 2021 build 2012 onwards... The scripts don't have this requirement
NOTE: You may need to download the MD preview version from: https://infinitekind.com/preview
(If you have installed the extension, but nothing happens, then check your Moneydance version)

The <module_name>.zip files in this directory contain both the Extension version (and the Script version if available).
Unzip this file, and then install the Extension, or run the Script, as required - see below:

_NOTE: On a Mac you might see one or two popup System Warning messages saying something like:
“jffinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn.dylib” cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.
macOS cannot verify that this app is free from malware.
These are irrelevant and harmless messages. Just click any option (Cancel, Ignore, Trash, Bin), it doesn't matter. 
The script will run un-affected. It's Mac Gatekeeper complaining about a dynamic cache file being created.
The Moneydance developer (IK) is aware of this and is trying to build a fix. It happens with all Python scripts._

To use extension (*.mxt):
- Run Moneydance
- Menu>Extensions>Manage Extensions>add from file>Select the mxt>Open/Install.
- Then exit and restart Moneydance 
- To run, Menu>Extensions> and choose the Extension to run

To use script (*.py):
- Run Moneydance
- Window>Show Moneybot Console
- Open Script>Choose the script
- RUN

Good luck - contact me with any issues.....
