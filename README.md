# Moneydance Python Scripts

Visit: https://yogi1967.github.io/MoneydancePythonScripts/ for downloads...

My collection of Python(Jython 2.7) scripts and extensions for Moneydance (MoneyBot console)

NOTE: My script (*.py) and extension (*.mxt) programs are exactly the same. Just the method to run changes.....
If you downloaded a zip file (extension *.zip) then unzip first in a directory of your choice to get at the file(s)

Extensions will only run on Moneydance version 2021 build 3056 onwards (ideally 3069+)...
The standalone script versions require a minimum of 2019.4 (build 1904 onwards)...
_(If you have installed the extension, but nothing happens, then check your Moneydance version)_

The <module_name>.zip files in this directory contain both the Extension version (and the Script version if available).
Unzip this file, and then install the Extension, or run the Script, as required - see below:

To use extension (*.mxt):
- Run Moneydance
- Drag and drop the .mxt file onto the Moneydance left side bar
- .. or Menu>Extensions>Manage Extensions>add from file>Select the mxt>Open/Install.
- Then exit and restart Moneydance 
- To run, Menu>Extensions> and choose the Extension to run

To use script (*.py):
- Run Moneydance
- Window>Show Moneybot Console
- Open Script>Choose the script
- RUN

Good luck - contact me with any issues.....
